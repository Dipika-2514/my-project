    <h1>ozymandias</h1>
    <h3>
        by percy bysshe shelley
    </h3>
    <p> i met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
    who said-"two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
    stand in the desert.... near them, on the sand, <br/>
    hald sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
    and wrinkled lip,and sneer of cold command,<br />
    tell that its sculptor well those passion read <br />
    which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
    the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
    and on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
    my name is ozymandias, kng of lings;<br />
    look my works,ye mighty, and despair!<br />
    nothing beside remains. round the decay<br />
    of tat colossal wreck, noundless and bare <br />
    the lone and level sand strech far away." <br /></p>
